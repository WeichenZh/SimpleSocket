2)    Predicted throughput:18 Mbps
      Predicted latency: 60 ms
      Actual throughput:15.906 Mbps
      Actual latency:62.06 ms
      Explanation of results: L1 is bottleneck, so the throughput of the path can't be greater than that. And the latency is the sum of all latency of links in the path.

3.1)  Predicted throughput:the sum of throughputs should be around 20 Mbps, and ideally the throughput of each pair is about 10 Mbps
      Predicted latency:60 ms
      Actual throughput:h1-h10:14.906 Mbps
                                      h5-h6: 15.281 Mbps
      Actual latency:62.523 ms
      Explanation of results:Two paths share same links, thus the throughput of each path should be the half of bottleneck if they communicate to the destination hosts at the same time. While the data of ping is small, there will be no more queuing delay, so the latencies remain unchanged. Actually, I don't know why the output is not consistent with my prediction.

3.2)  Predicted throughput: The sum of throughtpus should be around 20 Mbps. Ideally, the throughput of each pair is about 7 Mbps
      Predicted latency:60 ms
      Actual throughput: h1-h10: 11.207 Mbps
                                       h5-h6: 4.580 Mbps
                                       h2-h9: 8.577 Mbps
      Actual latency:62.35 ms
      Explanation of results:the reason is same as above.

4)    Predicted throughput: The sum of  throughputs is around 25 Mbps. Ideally, each throughput is about 12.5 Mbps.
      Predicted latency:h1-h10: 60 ms/ 15 ms
      Actual throughput: h1-h10: 8.089 Mbps
                                       h3-h8: 14.784 Mbps
      Actual latency: h1-h10:60.418 ms
                                h3-h8:15.256 ms
      Explanation of results:Two paths share L2, L4, so the throughput should be the half of least bandwith which is 25 Mbps. And latencies of these two path don't affect each other. So the latencies are the sum of latencies of link in each paths.
